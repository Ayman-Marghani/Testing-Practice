# Testing Practice

## Project Description
This project is part of The Odin Project's JavaScript course, focusing on test-driven development. It involves implementing various utility functions and writing comprehensive tests using Jest to ensure they work correctly.

## Functions Implemented
- **capitalize(str)**: Returns the string with the first character capitalized.
- **reverseString(str)**: Returns the reversed string.
- **calculator**: A class with methods for basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, divide, multiply).
- **caesarCipher(str, shift)**: Shifts each letter in the string by the shift factor, preserving case and punctuation.
- **analyzeArray(arr)**: Returns an object with average, min, max, and length of the array.

## Learned Skills
- Writing tests with Jest
- Test-driven development (TDD) principles
- Handling edge cases in functions (e.g., division by zero, empty arrays)
- Using CommonJS modules for exports
